# AnchorStage Pilot Close Template

## Objective
Close the demo with a specific pilot commitment request in under 40 seconds.

## Template fields
- `pilot_goal`
- `pilot_scope`
- `inputs_required_from_studio`
- `timeline`
- `success_metrics`
- `decision_request`

---

## Filled template (default)
- `pilot_goal`:
  - Validate camera-directed spatial reconstruction and deterministic extras in anime production conditions.

- `pilot_scope`:
  - One location family (single art direction).
  - Three shot types: reframe, subtle dolly, parallax pan.
  - Extras in two density presets with occlusion checks.
  - Two review cycles with studio notes integrated.

- `inputs_required_from_studio`:
  - 6-10 high-quality still backgrounds from one location family.
  - Preferred camera grammar references (2-3 examples).
  - Style preference for extras (crowd archetypes and motion tone).
  - Named creative approver and technical approver.

- `timeline`:
  - Week 1:
    - Scene prep and reconstruction pack.
    - First camera/extras pass.
  - Week 2:
    - Revisions from review cycle 1.
    - Final outputs and pass delivery.

- `success_metrics`:
  - At least 80 percent of delivered frames rated "usable without paintover" by studio creative lead.
  - Camera moves maintain confidence score above agreed threshold in target shots.
  - Extras pass occlusion validation in all selected hero frames.
  - Full pass bundle delivered for each approved frame (beauty/depth/void/extras ID/extras depth/proxy/confidence).

- `decision_request`:
  - "If this scope aligns, let’s confirm pilot approval today by naming your creative and technical owners and locking kickoff week."

## 40-second close script
"You just saw controlled camera movement and controlled extras from a single still, with compositing-ready passes.  
We propose a two-week pilot on one location family: three shot types, two review cycles, and deterministic extras with occlusion validation.  
From your side, we need source stills plus one creative and one technical approver.  
If this aligns, let’s lock kickoff week now and confirm owners before we leave this call."

## Objection handling snippets
- If asked about reliability:
  - "The confidence and void metrics are explicit per frame, so risk is observable and bounded."
- If asked about pipeline fit:
  - "We export depth/void/ID/depth-pass metadata specifically so compositing can integrate without custom tooling."
- If asked about scale:
  - "Pilot is intentionally scoped; expansion to additional locations is straightforward once shot grammar is validated."
